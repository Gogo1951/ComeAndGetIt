# Come & Get It!

A simple add-on to broadcast the location of mineral veins, herbs, and treasure chests that you can't use yourself.

Simply right-click on a node or chest, and Come & Get It will automatically prepare a message for your /1 General chat channel:

> {rt7} Come & Get It : Hey Miners, I came across a {Mineral Vein} that I can't mine at 25.5, 54.2!

> {rt7} Come & Get It : Hey Herbalists, I came across some {Herb} that I can't pick at 18.2, 36.5!

> {rt7} Come & Get It : Hey Rogues, I came across a locked {Treasure Chest} that I can't open at 18.3, 39.2!

Customizable Messaging: The message won't be sent until you hit Enter, giving you the flexibility to edit it or share it with your guild, party, or friends instead.
