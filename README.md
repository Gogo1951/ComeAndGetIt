# Come & Get It!

A simple add-on that allows you to easily broadcast the location of herbs or ore that you can't gather.

Right-click on a node, and Come & Get It! will prepare a message in your /1 channel:

> "{rt7} Come & Get It : Hey Miners, I found a Rich Thorium Vein that I can't use at 35.6, 67.8!"

The message won't be sent until you hit enter, so if you'd rather send it to your guild, friends, or another channel, feel free to edit it.
