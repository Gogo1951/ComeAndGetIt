# Come & Get It!

Right-click on an herb or ore that you can't gather, and Come & Get It! will prepare a message in your /1 channel:

> "{rt7} Come & Get It : Hey Miners, I found a Rich Thorium Vein at 35.6, 67.8!"

The message won't be sent until you hit enter, so if you'd rather send it to your guild, friends, or another channel, feel free to edit it.
